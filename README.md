# K-Means-Clustering-in-Banknote-Dataset
I used K-Means method to cluster the banknote data.

I used K-Means method to cluster the banknote data.

First I imported the necessary libraries and our banknote dataset using pandas. 
After that, I calculated some statistical measures like mean, standard deviation. 

Then I visualized where our points were clustered and visualized again with our calculated measures. 
While doing all these, I set the pyplot sub-library from the matplotlib library as plt and used the plt.scatter command.

Then I did normalization process.
Final step, I defined 3 center on the points of dataset. 
With used sklearn library, graphed normalized data and clustered data in my code.
